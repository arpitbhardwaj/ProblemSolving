 *
 * When to use recursion
 *
 * - When we can easily break down a problem into similar subproblem
 * - When we are fine with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it
 * - When we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one
 * - When traverse a tree
 * - When we use memoization in recursion
 *
 *
 * Recursion in 3 Steps
 *
 * Step 1 : Recursive case - the flow
 * Step 2 : Base case - the stopping criterion
 * Step 3 : Unintentional case - the constraint
