 * A single source problem is about finding a path between a given vertex (called source) to all other vertices in
 * a graph such that the total distance between them (source and destination) is minimum.
 * The problem:
 * - Five offices in different cities.
 * - Travel costs between these cities are known.
 * - Find the cheapest way from head office to branches in different cities
 *
 * BFS doesn't work with weighted graphs
