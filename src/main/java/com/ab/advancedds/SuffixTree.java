 * A suffix tree can be viewed as a data structure built on top of a compressed trie (radix tree) where,
 * instead of just adding the string itself into the trie,
 * you would also add every possible suffix of that string.
 * As an example, if you wanted to index the string banana in a suffix tree,
 * you would build a trie with the following strings:
 *
 * banana
 * anana
 * nana
 * ana
 * na
 * a
