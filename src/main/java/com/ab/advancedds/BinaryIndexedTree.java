 * A Binary Indexed Tree is also called fenwick tree
 * Use Case
 *      To get prefix sum queries
 *      To update an element
 *
 * Build a BI Tree
 * Convert to array index to Binary Representation -> flip the rightmost set bit to get the parent
 *
 * BI Tree for array contains n elements
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 * Time Complexity to serach and update: O(logn)
 * Time to create BI Tree first time is O(nlogn)
