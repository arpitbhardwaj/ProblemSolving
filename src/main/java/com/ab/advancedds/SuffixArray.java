 * A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string.
 * A suffix array can be constructed from Suffix tree by doing a DFS traversal on suffix tree.
 * In fact Suffix array and suffix tree both can be constructed from each other in linear time.
 *
 * Advantages of suffix arrays over suffix trees
 *  simpler linear time construction algorithms (e.g., compared to Ukkonenâ€™s algorithm)
 *  improved cache locality
